# ml-4-cpp
Implementation of some ML algorithms and basic linear algebra in C++ written from scratch.

- SimpleLinearRegressor
- MultipleLinearRegressor
- BinaryLogisticRegressor
- ...

## TODOs
- Write a high-performance version of the linalg class.
- Write tests for SimpleLinearRegressor
- ~~Implement MultipleLinearRegressor~~ & write tests
- ~~Implement BinaryLogisticRegressor~~ & write tests
- ~~Used row-major format for training data~~

## Tests
Tests have been written using the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) library.
