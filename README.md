# ml-4-cpp
Implementation of some ML algorithms and basic linear algebra in C++, written from scratch.

- SimpleLinearRegressor
- MultipleLinearRegressor (in progress)
- LogisticRegressor (Not yet implemented)
- ...

## To run
```
$ cd Debug
$ make
$ ./ml-4-cpp /full/path/to/your/data.csv
```

## TODOs
- Write a high-performance version of the linalg class.
- Write tests for SimpleLinearRegressor
- Implement MultipleLinearRegressor & write tests
- Implement LogisticRegressor & write tests

## Tests
Tests have been written using the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) library.
