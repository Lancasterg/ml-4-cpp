## TODOs
- ~~Write tests for SimpleLinearRegressor~~
- ~~Implement MultipleLinearRegressor~~ 
- ~~Implement BinaryLogisticRegressor & write tests~~
- ~~Used row-major format for training data~~
- Write tests for MultipleLinearRegressor
- ~~Finish implementation of DecisionTreeClassifier~~
- Fix main so that everything actually works (not just the tests)


## Tests
Tests have been written using the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) library.
